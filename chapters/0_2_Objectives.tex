The evolutionary dynamics of rapidly mutating biological systems involve complex interactions between localized genetic events and broader population-level outcomes, resulting in behaviors that are not well-captured by classical evolutionary models. Quantifying these processes necessitates robust modeling frameworks, a detailed understanding of gene-level heterogeneity, and scalable analytical methods. Therefore, this thesis has the following objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Investigate the underlying stochastic processes and localized mutation dynamics in rapidly mutating biological systems, assessing how these micro-level events collectively influence macroscale evolutionary outcomes.
    \item Evaluate selective pressures across diverse genomic segments and identify deviations from classical evolutionary models by employing alternative quantitative frameworks to elucidate patterns of adaptation and constraint.
    \item Verify whether the molecular clock hypothesis holds in rapidly mutating biological systems or if significant deviations arise due to localized genetic variability.
    \item Develop and implement integrated computational and statistical methodologies, coupled with novel large-scale open-source data treatment approaches, to bridge localized evolutionary events with comprehensive genomic-scale dynamics while ensuring reproducibility and scalability.
\end{enumerate}
